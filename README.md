## 🧠 About

I'm **Emmanuel Daniel Chonza**, passionate about building **end-to-end AI systems** that bridge research and real-world impact.

My expertise covers:
- Fine-tuning and evaluating **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
- Designing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic Systems** pipelines.
- Deploying **Computer Vision** and **Predictive ML** apps.
- Building dynamic, data-driven **Monitoring & Evaluation dashboards**.
- Building business recommendation systems powered by **NLP & Deep Learning**.
- Applying **MLOps/LLMOps** principles for reproducible and scalable experimentations.

I believe in one key principle:  
> ***“Build. Evaluate. Integrate. Deploy. Continuously Improve.”***.
