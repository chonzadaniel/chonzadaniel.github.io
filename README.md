## 🧠 About

I'm **Emmanuel Daniel Chonza**, passionate about building **end-to-end AI systems** that bridge research and real-world impact.

My expertise covers:
- Fine-tuning and evaluating **Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
- Designing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines  
- Deploying **Computer Vision** and **Predictive ML** apps  
- Building dynamic, data-driven **Monitoring & Evaluation dashboards**  
- Applying **MLOps/LLMOps** principles for scalable experimentation  

I believe in one principle:  
> *“Build. Evaluate. Iterate. Deploy. Share.”*
